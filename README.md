# K-Means Clustering Project

## Overview

This project involves developing a K-means clustering algorithm to segment retail store customers based on their purchase history. The goal is to enhance understanding of customer behavior and refine marketing strategies by grouping customers into distinct clusters.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found here: [Customer Segmentation Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned the data
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Normalized features

2. **Determining Optimal Clusters**
   - Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters by evaluating inertia values.

3. **Clustering and Analysis**
   - Implemented K-means clustering to group customers.
   - Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to gain actionable insights.

## Key Insights

1. **Optimal Number of Clusters:** Identified to be between 5 and 6 using the Elbow Method.
2. **Customer Segments:** Created detailed profiles of different customer groups to tailor marketing strategies effectively.
